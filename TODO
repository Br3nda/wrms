Write better documentation.

Bring the database installation and setup into the new millenium.

Convert it to use libawl-php, which is my web application libraries
that have co-evolved with this application and several others.

Provide better handling for themes.

Provide packaging for themes as separate items.

Update the README.Debian

Write some installation and configuration instructions.

Get some more creative comments for the package description.

Reimplement some of the more trivial listing reports using
the Browser class from libawl-php.  Especially syslist,
orglist, usrsearch and so forth.

Provide a postinst facility to automatically upgrade the
databases of all configured WRMSs.  Note that the user
that the website connects as usually doesn't have the
privileges for this action, so if the database is remote
it might be impossible from this server.  Deal with it. At
least we can advise which patches need to be applied.

Automate the detection of a database in need of updating
by manipulating a $recommended_schema_version to enable
nagging.

Add Debconf support, and ask some basic questions so we can
configure a VHost for Apache.

Add lots more questions so we can configure the whole darn
application with Debconf.

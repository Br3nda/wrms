    <h1>WRMS Not Configured</h1>
    <h2>The Bad News</h2>
    <p>There is no configuration file present in <b>/etc/wrms/<?php echo $HTTP_HOST; ?>-conf.php</b> so
       your installation is not fully set up.</p>
    <h2>The Good News</h2>
    <p>Well, you're seeing this! At least you have WRMS <i>installed</i> :-) You also have Apache and PHP working
       and so really you are well on the road to success!</p>
    <h2>The Dubious News</h2>
    <p>You could try and <a href="http://<?php echo $HTTP_HOST; ?>/docs/configuration.html">click here</a> and
       see if that enlightens you at all.  Odds are it's a fairly broken link, but it might work sooner
       or later so keep downloading new versions and trying again.  Or make some guesses.  Or bug Andrew :-)</p>
